# Ontology-template

Template for ontologies. Structured in view of using shared **continuous integration** and **documentation** workflows.

Currently, the following workflows are pre-defined:

* continuous integration (CI) (.github/workflows/ci.yml): the usual formal checks, using ROBOT, reasoners...
* WIDOCO generation (.github/workflows/widoco.yml), triggered by successful CI
* Wiki extraction (.github/workflows/wiki-extract.yml), triggered by successful CI

The shared workflows are in GitHub repository Airy59/OntoQA.

Replace this file with a proper readme.md describing your project.

Replace the default EUPL 1.2 license (that applies to the present template) by the license suitable for your project.
